üìÅ NYC Traffic Collision Data Analysis

<u>Project Overview</u>    
This project analyzes traffic collision data from New York City, spanning the years 2020 to 2023. The primary goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in traffic incidents to better understand the conditions and locations contributing to accidents. This type of analysis can support public safety initiatives, resource allocation, and policy decisions within urban planning and transportation departments.

Tools & Technologies Used  

-Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Filters, Charts, Conditional Formatting)

-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

<u>Data Understanding and Preparation</u>   
The dataset included thousands of rows detailing each collision: date, time, borough, location, number of persons injured/killed, contributing factors, and types of vehicles involved. The data required preprocessing to handle null values, ensure consistent formatting (e.g., time stamps), and remove irrelevant or duplicate rows. Once cleaned, the data was explored using Excel features like PivotTables and slicers to allow quick filtering by borough, year, and contributing factor.

Key Findings  

-Top Boroughs for Collisions: Brooklyn and Queens had the highest number of collisions, with hotspots identified in specific zip codes.

-Time of Day: Collisions were more frequent during peak traffic hours (7-9 AM and 4-7 PM), supporting known rush hour patterns.

-Day of Week and Month: Fridays and summer months showed spikes in collision volume, possibly due to increased travel.

-Vehicle and Factor Trends: Passenger vehicles were involved in the majority of accidents, with common contributing factors being driver inattention and failure to yield.

<u>Visualizations</u>    
Visual charts were created to present accident counts over time, distribution by borough, and contribution of different vehicle types and factors. These visuals help non-technical stakeholders quickly understand trends and support discussion in public safety planning.

<u>Impact & Conclusion</u>    
This analysis provided valuable insight into NYC's traffic safety concerns and helped highlight areas where interventions such as traffic calming, signal optimization, or public awareness campaigns could be introduced.
